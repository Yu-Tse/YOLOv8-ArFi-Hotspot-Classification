# Hotspot Detection in ArFi Lithography Using Deep Learning

This repository contains code, photomask layout datasets, and results for predicting sub-50nm trench hotspots in ArF immersion (ArFi) lithography using machine learning, as presented in the PMJ2025 conference paper (Photomask Japan, SPIE).

## Background

ArF immersion lithography (193i) is a key technology for high-volume manufacturing of advanced semiconductors. However, aggressive scaling (low k‚ÇÅ factor, e.g., k‚ÇÅ=0.335 for 48nm CD) introduces *hotspots*‚Äîregions prone to CD variations and yield loss, even after standard DRC and OPC. Traditionally, mask revision is used to correct these hotspots, but the process is costly and time-consuming.

We leverage machine learning to **detect lithographic hotspots** from layout images, aiming to accelerate and automate the hotspot review process and reduce human error.

## Main Features

- **YOLOv8 Classification Head Modification**  
  The provided code customizes the YOLOv8 classification head to fit the hotspot binary classification task and trains it using an image dataset generated by Prolith simulations.

- **Automated Training & Evaluation**  
  Includes scripts for training, validation, and testing, with reproducible hyperparameters and a focus on robust model selection.

- **Data Augmentation Pipeline**  
  Incorporates domain-specific augmentations, such as morphological operations (dilation/erosion), FFT-based filtering, and CAD-based synthetic pattern generation.

- **Results**  
  Achieved ~80% accuracy and F1 score of 0.75 for YOLOv8; up to 0.92 F-score for EfficientNet-B7 with proper augmentations (see paper for details).

## Research Highlights
Problem: Hotspot detection in 193i lithography at sub-50nm CD, using simulated layout images.

Approach: Train and evaluate YOLOv8 for binary classification (hotspot vs. good).

Augmentation: Morphological and frequency-domain transformations proved effective in boosting model performance.

### Results:

- YOLOv8: F1 = 0.75, accuracy = 0.8

### Limitations & Future Work
Dataset is based on Prolith simulation; performance on silicon (real) data yet to be validated.

Next steps include EUV simulation, larger datasets, and integrating generative AI for mask repair.
